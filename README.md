# SLAM-ultrasonic
A mapping robot that explores unknown environments and creates 2D maps using ultrasonic sensors. It transmits data via Serial to a Python script for processing and map generation. The robotâ€™s position is calculated using motion equations, with wheel speed data provided by encoders for precise results.
